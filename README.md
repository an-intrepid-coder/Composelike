#Composelike

**Description:** This is my latest attempt at a hobby Roguelike for Android. It uses the Jetpack Compose framework and is a work in progress. It is in the very earliest stages of prototyping but is far enough along to play with and share. It's a work in progress and this repo will grow rapidly.

**Sharing Note:** I only build apps for fun (so far) and I'm not a professional. I have no idea if the non-source project files which are included in this repo are ideal for sharing with others (I just included the default git changelist in my Android Studio IDE). If you want to fork this then you may have to do some extra work. I am open to pull requests or suggestions which will make it easier to share with interested people. In the meantime, this is a personal repo and I'm only concerned with it working on my machines; down the road this will change as I learn more and find a need to share the codebase with interested people.
