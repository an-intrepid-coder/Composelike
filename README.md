#Composelike

**Description:** This is my latest attempt at a hobby Roguelike for Android. It uses the Jetpack Compose framework and is a work in progress. It is in the very earliest stages of prototyping but is far enough along to play with and share. It's a work in progress and this repo will grow rapidly.

**Disclaimer:** I am not a professional. This is something I'm doing for fun and practice. If anyone wants to contribute, or finds this helpful in any way, then that is awesome; but this is my own little hobby project first and foremost. It is in such early stages that I have not done anything in the way of making it a viable Template app for Android, although I would like to implement best practices such as Testing and full Material Design adherence down the road. I have a rough style sometimes but it is something I'm working on, and I'll be updating this often. If it interests anyone, feel free to keep checking back in.

**Current Focus:** Procedural Map Generation, optimization refactorings, and improving my style.

**Sharing Note:** I only build apps for fun (so far) and I'm not a professional. I have no idea if the non-source project files which are included in this repo are ideal for sharing with others (I just included the default git changelist in my Android Studio IDE). If you want to fork this then you may have to do some extra work. I am open to pull requests or suggestions which will make it easier to share with interested people. In the meantime, this is a personal repo and I'm only concerned with it working on my machines; down the road this will change as I learn more and find a need to share the codebase with interested people.

**Material Design:** I have not done anything with Material Design or theming yet. All of the graphics are procedural and use Strings and Characters. This will change in time but my focus is on the game itself for now.

**Internet Facing:** This app does not yet have any internet-facing capabilities, but I would eventually like to be able to set up online high score lists and other common online features of Roguelikes. Maybe way down the road it could be on the App Store.
